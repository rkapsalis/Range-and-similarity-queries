# Range and similarity queries
In this repository we have implemented a B+ Tree to execute range and exact match queries and a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithm, using the MinHash method for finding similar documents as measured by Jaccard similarity.

## Implementation
### B+ Tree

### LSH

## Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/rkapsalis/Range-and-similarity-queries.git` to clone the repository
* `cd Range-and-similarity-queries` to access the project directory
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
* `python main.py`
